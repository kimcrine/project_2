## *FOR THE GAME. FOR THE WORLD.* ##

Welcome to the one-stop site for all your FIFA stats! Like many soccer/football fans around the world, our group loves looking up stats about our favorite players and teams. And what better way to view those stats than through dynamic and exciting visualizations? 

Our project creates the perfect application for users to toggle between various comparison charts, interactive maps and quick stat charts for the best players in the world. We started by transforming our dataset, building our own sqlite database and using Python-flask to power our API. On our site, we included a variety of user-driven interactions like drop-down boxes, menus and button toggling. 

Take a look around and explore our dashboard! Perhaps you'll find some surprising information on your favorite players!
